# Counter with Riverpod - using Consumer

A counter-app using the [Riverpod library](https://riverpod.dev/).

In contrast to the [first example](../01%20counter), here we use
the [Consumer widget](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_riverpod/latest/flutter_riverpod/Consumer-class.html)
to only re-render the widgets dependent on the counter value.

Example used in the
course [IDATA2503 Mobile applications](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2503)
at [NTNU](https://ntnu.edu), campus [Aalesund](https://www.ntnu.edu/alesund).
