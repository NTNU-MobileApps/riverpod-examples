# Firebase authentication with Riverpod StreamProvider

An example showing how to use [StreamProvider](https://riverpod.dev/docs/providers/stream_provider/)
with the [Riverpod library](https://riverpod.dev/) to authenticate with Firebase.

Example used in the
course [IDATA2503 Mobile applications](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2503)
at [NTNU](https://ntnu.edu), campus [Aalesund](https://www.ntnu.edu/alesund).

Note: this authenticates towards a dummy-project. To provide your own project, update the Firebase
project settings (`google-services.json` in the `android/app` directory, etc.)
